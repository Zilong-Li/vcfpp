* Build R package

If you want to build a R package using vcfpp, here are the steps:

- download [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/vcfpp/releases/latest][vcfpp.h]] and [[https://github.com/samtools/htslib][htslib]] in =src= folder.
- create an =Makevars= file in =src= folder with
  #+begin_src R
  PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I. -Ihtslib/
  PKG_LIBS = $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS) htslib/libhts.a -fPIC -lz -lbz2 -llzma -lcurl

  .PHONY: all
  all : $(SHLIB)
  $(SHLIB) : HTSLIB

  CC=$(shell "R CMD config CC")
  CXX=$(shell "R CMD config CXX")
  CPPFLAGS=$(shell "R CMD config CPPFLAGS")
  LDFLAGS=$(shell "R CMD config LDFLAGS")

  HTSLIB:
      cd htslib && autoreconf -i && ./configure --with-libdeflate=no && $(MAKE) libhts.a CXX="$(CXX)" CC="$(CC)" CPPFLAGS="$(CPPFLAGS) -fPIC " && cd ..
  #+end_src

* Write R scripts

If you don't want to build a R package, then you just need to install
[[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/vcfpp/releases/latest][vcfpp.h]] and [[https://github.com/samtools/htslib][htslib]] in your R system enviroment. For example, assume
you have a conda enviroment =~/mambaforge/envs/R=, the system
envrionment are =~/mambaforge/envs/R/include= for header files and
=~/mambaforge/envs/R/lib= for library file. Then you can compile and run
functions from the =vcfpp-read.cpp= file in R by

#+begin_src R
library(Rcpp)
Sys.setenv("PKG_LIBS"="-I~/mambaforge/envs/R/include -L~/mambaforge/envs/R/include -lhts")
sourceCpp("vcfpp-read.cpp", verbose=TRUE, rebuild=TRUE)
#+end_src
