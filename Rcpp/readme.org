* Build R package

There is a R package https://github.com/Zilong-Li/vcfppR demonstrates
how to build your own R package with vcfpp. Here are the important steps:

- download [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/vcfpp/releases/latest][vcfpp.h]] and [[https://github.com/samtools/htslib][htslib]] in =src= folder.
- copy the [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/vcfppR/blob/main/src/Makevars][Makevars]] file in =src= folder

* Write R scripts

If you don't want to build a R package, then you just need to install
[[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/vcfpp/releases/latest][vcfpp.h]] and [[https://github.com/samtools/htslib][htslib]] in your system environment. For example, assume
you have a conda environment =~/mambaforge/envs/R=, the system
environment are =~/mambaforge/envs/R/include= for header files and
=~/mambaforge/envs/R/lib= for library files. Then you can compile and run
functions from the =Rcpp_example.cpp= file in R by

#+begin_src R
library(Rcpp)
## setup library path if they are not in the system env
Sys.setenv("PKG_LIBS"="-I~/mambaforge/envs/R/include -L~/mambaforge/envs/R/include -lhts")
sourceCpp("Rcpp_example.cpp", verbose=TRUE, rebuild=TRUE)
#+end_src
